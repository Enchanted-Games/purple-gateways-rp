# Purple Gateways Remastered
Purple Gateways Remastered is an updated and improved version of my [Purple Gateways](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/purple-gatewats/) pack.
I wanted to give End Portals and Gateways a more stylised look that could fit in the vanilla game.

## What this pack does

PGR changes the look of both End Portals and Gateways with a new and improved texture which includes different sized stars and a galaxy that can appear. This pack also uses shaders to improve the rendering of the stars slightly by making them use a different colour palette and making them not stretch on wider aspect ratios.


## New in v2
Version 2 of this pack improves the end portal and end gateway rendering from the previous version. This includes new colour palettes for the gateway and portal, as well as improved rendering


## Performance

This pack may be very slightly worse in performance compared to the vanilla end portal on lower end devices. This shouldn't matter too much though as you rarely see the whole screen full of end portals.
